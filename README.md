# 🧠 Automation Hub

> A centralized collection of automation workflows designed to streamline tasks, integrate tools, and optimize processes.

---

## 📂 Overview

This repository serves as a hub for automation workflows — each stored in its own folder.
Every workflow is built to simplify repetitive tasks, improve efficiency, and connect multiple tools or platforms seamlessly.

---

## 🏗️ Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a standalone workflow:

```
automation-hub/
├── workflow-1/
│   ├── workflow.json
│   ├── README.md
│   └── assets/
├── workflow-2/
│   ├── workflow.json
│   ├── README.md
│   └── assets/
└── ...
```

**Folder structure guidelines:**

* `workflow.json`: the exported automation workflow file (e.g., from n8n or similar tools)
* `README.md`: brief documentation explaining the workflow’s purpose, setup, and usage
* `assets/`: optional screenshots, diagrams, or supplementary files
